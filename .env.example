# Password configuration
# PASSWORD_MODE determines how authentication works:
# - local: Password can be empty (no auth required) or set for basic auth
# - env: MY_PASSWORD must be set and cannot be empty
# - db: Database-based authentication (not implemented yet)
PASSWORD_MODE=local

# The actual password to use
# - In 'local' mode: can be empty (no auth) or set for basic auth
# - In 'env' mode: must be set and cannot be empty
# - In 'db' mode: not used (password stored in database)
MY_PASSWORD=
